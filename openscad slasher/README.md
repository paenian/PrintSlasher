# PrintSlasher - openscad tests
Before spending time on Python to make a more powerful version, I'm going to write a simple framework in OpenSCAD, which already incorporates the CGAL library for boolean mesh operations.

This might be a better solution than python, really... but mostly I want to get an end-to-end demonstration chained together as rabidly as possible, since this idea requires a bunch of steps to all work together.
